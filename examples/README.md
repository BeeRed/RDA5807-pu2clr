# Examples Folder


[This folder](https://github.com/pu2clr/RDA5807/tree/master/examples) has some examples that might help you to use the RDA5807 Arduino Library in your receiver project. If you find some error or problem during your implementation, please let me know. 

__This project is about a library to control the RDA5807 device and the focus of this project is the library and its functionalities. Please, don't ask me to assist you in your: displays, encoders, LED, buttons or something else out the library scope. Thanks.__

The examples stored in this folder are made to assist you to build your own sketch. Therefore, it is important to say that there was no care with the layout. This part of the project stays with you.


The [RDA5807_01_SERIAL_MONITOR](https://github.com/pu2clr/RDA5807/tree/master/examples/RDA_01_SERIAL_MONITOR) folder shows how you can check your circuit by using just the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor to control the receiver. Check the examples with Atmega328 and ESP32. __In the sketch you will find the wireup with Atmega328 or ESP32 and RDA5807 device__.
